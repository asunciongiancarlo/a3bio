It aims to provide quality healthcare for Filipinos.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the aid of the public health insurance the Filipinos are getting from Phil Health, it would not suffice the payment needed for the medical expenses incurred during hospitalization of most Filipinos. That is when HMOs and medical insurance play a role in easing out the financial burden brought about by the hospital bill. Thus, these private health insurance comes to pay depending on the medical coverage bought by the insured individual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A private health insurance comes either as an HMO or a medical insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)</em></strong>&nbsp; provides health services for a fixed annual fee. It is a type of plan that usually limits coverage to care from doctors who work for or is in contract with the HMO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HMO provides comprehensive medical care to group of voluntary subscribers on basis of prepaid contract. It may require you to live or work in its service area to be eligible for coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here in the Philippines, the HMO is regulated by the Association of Health Maintenance Organizations of the Philippines, Inc. (AHMOPI). It is a recognized trade association that was registered on the 13th&nbsp;of November to protect the interest of the industry as well as the members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HMO&rsquo;s are more common here in the Philippines.

The coverage of the insured depends on the type of plan bought.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;An example of a medical insurance provider is Pacific Cross.
